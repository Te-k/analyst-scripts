# OONI scripts

* `download_measurements.py`: download raw measurements from OONI (maybe buggy, [oonidata](https://github.com/ooni/data) is an alternative that is likely more reliable)
* `get_ooni_signal_status.py`: provides data on recent Signal measurements
* `get_ooni_telegram.py`: provide data on recent Telegram measurements
* `get_ooni_website_status.py`: provide data on recent website measurements
